# CLEANED Batch Emissions Calculator (Venture37)

This repository provides an automated workflow to estimate livestock greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the **CLEANED** (Comprehensive Livestock Environmental Assessment) framework.  
It was developed for Venture37 Kenya data and is designed to scale to large farm datasets.

## üß© Overview

The script automates the CLEANED modeling workflow to:
- Import and harmonize farm-level Excel data collected through interviews.  
- Construct standardized CLEANED input objects per farm and livestock type.  
- Run core CLEANED modules for feed quality, energy, land, soil, nitrogen, and emissions.  
- Generate results as both Excel workbooks and JSON outputs.  
- Compute enteric methane (CH‚ÇÑ) intensity per kilogram of Fat- and Protein-Corrected Milk (FPCM).

This allows comparison of baseline versus improved feed basket scenarios and quantifies changes in emissions efficiency across 230+ farms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Automated Processing**: Loops through multiple Excel input files.  
- **Standardized Outputs**: Writes full CLEANED result tables (Excel + JSON).  
- **FPCM Normalization**: Calculates CH‚ÇÑ intensity (kg CH‚ÇÑ ¬∑ kg‚Åª¬π FPCM).  
- **Integrated Parameters**: Pulls reference data and emission factors from the CLEANED package.  
- **Scalable Design**: Reusable for national or program-level livestock mitigation assessments.
