abstract: >
  Automates CLEANED-based GHG assessment for livestock farms using Venture37
  survey data. Processes multiple Excel files, computes emissions and CHâ‚„
  intensity per kg of Fat- and Protein-Corrected Milk (FPCM), and outputs
  standardized Excel/JSON results. Enables partners to evaluate feed improvement
  impacts across farms at scale.
